# Motivation 
What is the extent of a person's knowledge? Teaching is gold proof of mastery, but outside of that, we often rely on proxies. In the job application process, a person's educational background, work history or performance on a coding test are common ones. One personal favorite of mine is looking at someone's bookshelf as it can potentially be a glimpse into the contents of their mind. As a huge fan of self-learning, I've done my fair share. I started with local library books on dinosaurs, continued on with gems like *The Feynman Lectures on Physics* in college and *Principles of Quantum Mechanics* in graduate school.  


After graduate school, I dedicated myself to becoming a data scientist by first studying fundamentals, including graduate level statistics and Python/machine learning related online courses. This habit of self-study took great discipline to develop and I'm proud of all the work I've put in and continue to put in, yet there's not enough room for it on a resume. The content of this page is an attempt at some documentation of my self-learning journey and what you'd see on my personal bookshelf.

# What's on my shelf?

## Physics
- [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/index.html) by Richard Feynman
  - These volumes have a wealth of insight and beautiful exposition straight from one of greatest teachers and legends of the subject. What other physics text has the Krebs Cycle?
- [Principles of Quantum Mechanics](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Quantum-Mechanics-2nd-Shankar/dp/0306447908/ref=asc_df_0306447908?mcid=9ac2bf11d48e36a7a5fb25f3a3845ea3&hvocijid=6271115953609912194-0306447908-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6271115953609912194&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9191415&hvtargid=pla-2281435179538&psc=1) by Ramamurti Shankar
  - With solved problems, fantastic organization and such a strong 1st chapter, this text helped me learn quantum mechanics more than any of the numerous classes I've taken.

## Mathematics

- [How to Prove It](https://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-Structured-Daniel-Velleman/dp/110842418X/ref=asc_df_110842418X?mcid=5af9469a059e313b9ba60a74ff76f0aa&hvocijid=15755551501711694689-110842418X-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15755551501711694689&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9191415&hvtargid=pla-2281435178098&psc=1) by Daniel J. Velleman
  - I recall stumbling through proofs before working through the first few chapters of this helpful resource.
- [All of Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/All-Statistics-Statistical-Inference-Springer/dp/1441923225) by Larry Wasserman
  - This book has such a high range of topics and working through through many of the problems yielded long-lasting insights into graduate statistics.
- [Statistical Inference](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/0534243126) by George Casella and Roger Berger 
  - This is a staple reference whenever I find myself requiring deeper insight into fundamentals.
