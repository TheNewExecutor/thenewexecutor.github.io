# Motivation 
What is the extent of a person's knowledge? Teaching is gold proof of mastery, but outside of that, we often rely on proxies. In the job application process, a person's educational background, work history or performance on a coding test are common ones. One personal favorite of mine is looking at someone's bookshelf as it can potentially be a glimpse into the contents of their mind. As a huge fan of self-learning, I've done my fair share. I started with local library books on dinosaurs, continued on with gems like *The Feynman Lectures on Physics* in college and *Principles of Quantum Mechanics* in graduate school.  


After graduate school, I dedicated myself to becoming a data scientist by first studying fundamentals, including graduate level statistics and Python/machine learning related online courses. This habit of self-study took great discipline to develop and I'm proud of all the work I've put in and continue to put in, yet there's not enough room for it on a resume. The content of this page is an attempt at some documentation of my self-learning journey and what you'd see on my personal bookshelf.
